# CrossyTortilla
A simple, yet beautiful interface I created for an independent reading project in my AP English Language and Composition class in high school.
It was used as a creative mode of presentation to display a key motif in the novel "The Tortilla Curtain", the motif being a highway running through the Topanga Canyon in sunny Southern California.
Our controllable protagonist, CÃ¡ndido, wishes to cross the highway to the land of opportunity, being the United States.  
His journey is symbolic of the trials and tribulations of the American Dream; hence, this creation is a true work of art.
